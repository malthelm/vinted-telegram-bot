## Implementation Details

### Main Application (main.js)

The main application initializes the bot and sets up the necessary services:

- Initializes the proxy manager
- Initializes and starts the Telegram bot
- Creates and configures the monitoring service
- Fetches the initial cookie from Vinted
- Sets up periodic cookie refresh
- Configures metrics collection
- Handles graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup

### Monitoring Service

The monitoring service is responsible for checking for new items:

- Periodically polls Vinted for new items
- Filters items based on user preferences
- Sends notifications to users when new items are found
- Handles concurrency to avoid rate limiting
- Manages cookie updates for authentication
- Records metrics for monitoring

### Performance Optimization

The application includes several performance optimizations:

- **Caching**: Reduces API calls by caching responses
- **Database Indexes**: Improves query performance
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimizes database connections
- **Concurrency Control**: Limits concurrent API requests to avoid rate limiting

### Monitoring and Metrics

The application includes comprehensive monitoring:

- **Metrics Collection**: Tracks API calls, errors, and system performance
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provides real-time insights into system performance
- **Error Tracking**: Records and categorizes errors for easier debugging

### Bot Commands

The following commands have been implemented:

1. **/start**: Registers a new user or welcomes an existing user
2. **/help**: Shows help information and available commands
3. **/monitor**: Creates a new monitor for a Vinted search URL
4. **/stop**: Stops and deletes a specific monitor
5. **/list**: Lists all active monitors for the user
6. **/filter**: Adds keyword filters to a monitor
7. **/settings**: Allows users to change their preferences
8. **/admin**: Provides admin-only functionality (stats, user management, etc.)
9. **/dashboard**: Shows system metrics and performance data

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components
3. **Mock Data**: Provides consistent test data

### Deployment

The project includes production-ready deployment configuration:

1. **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates the application and database
2. **Environment Variables**: Configurable settings for production
3. **Deployment Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for deployment
