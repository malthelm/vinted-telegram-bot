## Usage

1. Start a chat with your bot on Telegram.
2. Use the `/start` command to get started.
3. Use the `/help` command to see all available commands.
4. Use the `/monitor` command followed by a Vinted search URL to start monitoring.

## Available Commands

- `/start` - Start the bot
- `/help` - Show help message
- `/monitor <url>` - Start monitoring a Vinted search URL
- `/stop <id>` - Stop monitoring a specific search
- `/list` - List all your active monitors
- `/filter <id> <keywords>` - Add keyword filters to a monitor
- `/settings` - Change your preferences
- `/dashboard` - (Admin only) View system metrics and performance

## Admin Dashboard

Administrators can access the dashboard to monitor system performance:

- `/dashboard` - View system overview
- `/dashboard:api` - View API metrics
- `/dashboard:errors` - View error metrics
- `/dashboard:system` - View system metrics
- `/dashboard:cache` - Clear cache

## Performance Optimizations

The bot includes several performance optimizations:

- **Caching**: Reduces API calls by caching responses
- **Database Indexes**: Improves query performance
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimizes database connections
- **Concurrency Control**: Limits concurrent API requests to avoid rate limiting

## Proxy Support

The bot supports proxies to avoid rate limiting. You can use Webshare.io for proxy management or provide your own proxies in a `proxies.txt` file.
